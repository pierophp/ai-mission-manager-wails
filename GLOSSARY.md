# AI Mission Manager

A personal control plane for work that is done by the user, delegated to AI coding agents, or merely watched. It sits above trackers, forges, Git and the terminal runtime, and its job is to retain the relationships between them.

## Language

### Organising work

**Context**:
A top-level boundary isolating one area of work, along with its providers and repositories. A Context may have no execution Machine while being configured; once one is assigned, every Run and Worktree in that Context uses it. An Item belongs to exactly one Context.
_Avoid_: workspace, tenant, account, area

**Project**:
A container for Items inside a Context. It owns its configured Repositories and supplies the defaults Items created in it inherit. Every Item can use all Repositories configured for its Project.
_Avoid_: folder, category, epic

**Item**:
Something the user has intentionally decided to do, delegate, or keep on their radar. Everything else in the model hangs off it.
_Avoid_: task, ticket, issue, card, mission

### External work

**External Object**:
A single thing owned by an external system — a GitHub Issue, a pull request, a Jira work item. It exists once no matter how many Items refer to it.
_Avoid_: ticket, remote item, upstream object

**Spec**:
An External Object or local Markdown document linked to an Item as the description of work to be done. It may have Tickets that break the work down for an Implementation Queue.
_Avoid_: plan, parent issue

**Ticket**:
An External Object or local Markdown file linked to a Spec as one implementable piece of work, with its own order and blocking relationships for an Implementation Queue.
_Avoid_: task, sub-issue

**Link**:
The pairing of one Item with one External Object, carrying the user's own state about it: which changes they care about, and how far they have reviewed.
_Avoid_: association, reference, join

**Repository**:
A Git repository's canonical identity, registered under a Project, making it available to every Item in that Project. Not any particular checkout of it.
_Avoid_: checkout, clone, worktree

**Worktree**:
One physical Git worktree for one Repository and one Item, associated with a Machine, path, branch, and base branch.
_Avoid_: workspace, checkout

### Execution

**Terminal Runtime**:
The external program that owns terminal processes, sessions and Panes and keeps them alive between app restarts. AI Mission Manager directs one through an adapter and never reimplements it.
_Avoid_: multiplexer, terminal, tmux

**Machine**:
An execution target reachable through the Terminal Runtime, whether local or remote. A Machine is registered under one Context and may be assigned as the execution Machine for multiple Contexts.
_Avoid_: host, server, node

**Agent CLI Configuration Profile**:
A named configuration directory for Claude Code or Codex on one Machine. Contexts assigned to that Machine can reuse its profiles independently for each provider.
_Avoid_: Execution Profile, account

**Execution Mode**:
The checkout strategy used by a Run: a direct checkout or a Worktree.
_Avoid_: mode

**Run**:
One attempt at doing work on an Item by a single agent, using a Repository checkout configured for the Item's Project, either directly or through one physical Worktree. Runs are historical records while they are retained, but finished Runs may be explicitly deleted as part of local cleanup; an active Run blocks deletion of its Item, Machine, Project, or Context.
_Avoid_: session, job, execution, attempt

**Pane**:
A single terminal owned by the Terminal Runtime. A Pane running an agent is what a Run points at; Panes may also hold shells, tests or servers with no Run attached.
_Avoid_: terminal, tab, window

**Execution Profile**:
The kind of instruction prepared for an agent when a Run starts — investigate, implement, review, grill, or a custom prompt.
_Avoid_: mode, template, preset

**Workflow**:
The development method a Run follows, either `matt-pocock` or `pstack`. A Context supplies its default, and a Run may override it at launch; the Workflow stays fixed for that Run and determines its available Execution Profiles. It is distinct from an Execution Profile and an Execution Mode.
_Avoid_: mode

**Initial Prompt**:
The user's own words for one Run, sent alongside its Execution Profile's instruction. It starts as a copy of the Item's Notes and is edited for that Run only; the Notes are not added to the prompt separately. For a custom prompt it is the whole instruction, so it cannot be blank.
_Avoid_: custom prompt source, notes

**Implementation Queue**:
An ordered selection of open Tickets linked to an Item's Spec, arranged by their captured order and blocking relationships. It records the launch configuration, checkout approvals, and the Run attached to its first entry; only one active queue may exist per Item.
_Avoid_: batch, ticket batch

**Plan Usage**:
How much of a provider subscription one Agent CLI Configuration Profile has consumed, as that provider reports it: a set of Usage Windows plus the moment the reading was taken. It is read per profile, never per Context or per Run.
_Avoid_: quota, credits, billing

**Usage Window**:
One limit a provider meters against — a rolling five-hour window, a weekly window, a per-model weekly window — carrying the percentage used and when it resets. Providers disagree on which windows exist, so the set is whatever the provider reported rather than a fixed list.
_Avoid_: bucket, limit, period

### Attention

**Needs Attention**:
The cross-cutting inbox of everything currently asking for the user's involvement. It is not an Item state; an Item in any state may appear in it.
_Avoid_: inbox, alerts, notifications

**Attention Entry**:
One unit of demand inside Needs Attention, gathering every unreviewed change from a single source into one thing to act on.
_Avoid_: notification, alert, event

**Activity**:
The full record of observed change, whether or not any of it was worth the user's attention.
_Avoid_: feed, history, log

**Watch**:
The user's intent to keep something on their radar for a period, independent of whether anything happens to it.
_Avoid_: subscription, follow, monitor

**Reminder**:
A scheduled moment at which an Item should be put back in front of the user. Set on the Item itself.
_Avoid_: alarm, due date, deadline
